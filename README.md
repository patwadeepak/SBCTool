To run the application on any platform -
1. Navigate to a folder where you want to put the app
2. git clone https://github.com/patwadeepak/sbctool
3. cd sbctool
4. pip install -f requirements.txt
5. double click run-on-windows.bat

Meanwhile I am figuring out how to distribute my python app more easily.
